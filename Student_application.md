# Guideline For student application 
## Overview for Students

Applications that do not contain at least the minimum information in the
template **will not** get a slot.

The best applications are concise but show considerable thought and planning.

If you have questions about details, contact your mentors first.  If you
still have choices to make or different possible approaches, explore the
most likely ones in your application. The goal of your application is to
demonstrate your capacity to complete the project over the course of the summer,
demonstrate that you've given a fair amount of thought to an implementation 
approach, and plan, as much as possible,
for choices that may change the goals or timeline in the application. 

Once your draft application has been submitted, you may receive comments
from other C3G mentors, either listed project mentors or others.  Please 
respond to the comments promptly and completely.  Being non-responsive 
before you've even been awarded a slot is not a good sign for the 
success of your proposal.
